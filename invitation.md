# Localization Challenge 2016
(Co-located with IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium 2016)
  
http://sensorapps.org/ 

Show off your Smartphone App for navigating indoors without GPS!   
There are many situations in which navigating using a smartphone without GPS 
would be very useful.  Such environments include complex buildings and even 
some outdoor locations in urban environments.  We have devised a challenge to 
test the accuracy of inertial navigation applications on mobile devices for 
a variety of situations.  

The venue for the symposium in Catania includes a museum with multiple levels 
and nooks and crannies.  We will collect data from the attendees on their 
mobile devices on the first day, and it will be available on the second day.
Thus, there will be a variety of hardware platforms and user characteristics. 
There will be multiple challenges.  The applications will be judged on the 
accuracy in localizing the device, based on sensor data.

Awards will be given to the top teams! 

## Overview of Challenges
* accelerometers and gyroscope only
* accelerometers, gyroscope and WiFi Beacons
* other sensors?

# Notes
* Check the schedule for an open evening for dinner discussion.
* Do we offer prizes?
* Will the winners be acknowledged at the banquet?

# Letter to likely participants
Dear ..., in your paper you discussed indoor navigation.  Are you interested 
in participating in the localization challenge for indoor naviagation at SAS?  
We will make available data such as accelerometer and gyroscopic data. If you 
were to participate, what additional sensor data would you want to use? The 
goal will be to estimate the final position of the device as closely as 
possible.
The indoor environment is a multilevel museum.
